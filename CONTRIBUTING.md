Contributing
======

Thank you for considering to contribute to this project. There are several ways to help, such as submitting bug reports and feature requests, providing use-case examples, or writing code which can further extend the capabilities of the observation monad.

General questions and discussions can be posted in our [Gitter channel](TODOLINKHERE). Any security issues should be submitted directly to one of our official [maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md). 

## How to create a pull request

A few guidelines to consider before creating a pull request:
* Ensure that new code meets a direct need or adds value in some way.
* Ensure that new code is tested.
* Ensure that new code is documented, if applicable.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.

Steps to create a pull request:
1. Create your own fork of the codebase.
2. Commit the changes in your fork, in a dedicated branch.
3. Send us a pull request with a link to your changes.

## How to report a bug

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
1. What version of Scala and SBT are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement
The observation monad provides a type-safe way of composing and transforming one or multiple data points in a functional manner. If you find there is some functionality missing in the observation monad, feel free to add an issue to our issue list on GitHub, describing:
* Which feature you would like to see.
* Why you need it.
* How it should work.
